        <h1>Tacos</h1>
            <h3>Description</h3>
                <p>I have had great success preparing tacos this way. I bought this recipe from a taqueria owner (taco restaurant) in Mexico City. I am translating the directions.
                It can be used for beef, pork, or just about any other type of meat. The spice mix on this recipe gives meat a really excellent flavor.</p>
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>1/2 onion</li>
                        <li>2 cloves garlic</li>
                        <li>2 teaspoons fresh parsley</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
                        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
                        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                        <li>2 lb flank steak</li>
                        <li>24 corn tortillas</li>
                    </ul>
            <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Place 1/2 chopped onion, 2 cloves garlic, parsley, oregano, 
                            paprika, anise seed, black pepper, cumin, sage, thyme, bay leaves, 
                            cloves, soy sauce, vinegar, orange juice, and lime juice in a blender; pulse until a 
                            very well-blended paste is achieved, scraping down sides as needed, 3 to 5 minutes. 
                            Spread paste on both sides of the flank steak. Wrap steak in plastic and refrigerate 
                            at least 6 hours to overnight. </li>

                        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove excess 
                            marinade from flank steak. </li>

                        <li> Grill steak until it begins to firm and is hot and slightly pink in the center, about
                             8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 
                             140 degrees F (60 degrees C). Chop steak into small pieces and transfer to a platter; 
                             cover and keep warm until ready to serve. </li>

                        <li>Place 1 chopped onion, tomatoes, chipotle peppers, and 3 cloves garlic in a blend; 
                            pulse until desired consistency. Add water if the salsa becomes too thick. 
                            Transfer salsa to a bowl. </li>

                        <li>Heat tortillas in a microwave safe plate until warm, about 1 minute. </li>

                        <li>Serve beef over stacks of two corn tortillas with salsa and sprinkle with 
                            remaining 1/2 chopped onion, radishes, and cilantro. </li>
                    </ol>
